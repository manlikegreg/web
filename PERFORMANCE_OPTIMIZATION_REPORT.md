```

### Chunk Optimization
- **Framer Motion**: Separated into dedicated chunk for better caching
- **UI Libraries**: Grouped into single chunk for efficient loading
- **Common Code**: Shared across all pages for optimal reuse

### Performance Features Added
1. **LightweightAnimation Component**: Replaces heavy Framer Motion usage
2. **OptimizedImage Component**: Implements lazy loading and optimization
3. **PerformanceMonitor Component**: Tracks Core Web Vitals
4. **ServiceWorker Component**: Enables offline functionality
5. **Dynamic Imports**: Reduces initial bundle size

## Mobile Optimizations
- ✅ Disabled heavy animations on mobile devices
- ✅ Optimized touch targets for better usability
- ✅ Implemented mobile-specific CSS optimizations
- ✅ Added reduced motion support for better performance

## Accessibility Improvements
- ✅ Added reduced motion support for users with vestibular disorders
- ✅ Improved focus visibility and keyboard navigation
- ✅ Optimized touch targets for better mobile accessibility
- ✅ Maintained semantic HTML structure

## Browser Support
- ✅ Modern browsers with ES6+ support
- ✅ Graceful degradation for older browsers
- ✅ Progressive enhancement approach
- ✅ Service worker support for modern browsers

## Monitoring & Analytics
- ✅ Core Web Vitals tracking (FCP, LCP, FID, CLS, TTFB)
- ✅ Component render time monitoring
- ✅ Async operation performance tracking
- ✅ Page load time measurement

## Recommendations for Further Optimization

### Short Term
1. **Image Optimization**: Implement WebP format with fallbacks
2. **CDN Integration**: Use a CDN for static assets
3. **Critical CSS**: Extract and inline critical CSS
4. **Resource Hints**: Add preload/prefetch hints for critical resources

### Long Term
1. **Edge Computing**: Consider edge functions for dynamic content
2. **Progressive Web App**: Add PWA features for better mobile experience
3. **Advanced Caching**: Implement more sophisticated caching strategies
4. **Performance Budget**: Set and monitor performance budgets
